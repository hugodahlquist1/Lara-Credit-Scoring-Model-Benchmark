# Lara-Credit-Scoring-Model-Benchmark

The Lara project establishes a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to evaluate and select the optimal machine learning algorithm for credit risk assessment and delinquency prediction. I engineered a modular experimentation suite that leverages Scikit-Learn Pipelines to ensure consistent, leak-free preprocessing and scaling across cross-validation folds. A central focus of this analysis was addressing severe class imbalance, through comparative testing, I demonstrated that algorithmic adjustments using class weighting yielded superior discrimination between good and bad payers. The study evaluated Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks, ultimately identifying XGBoost as the top performer with the highest Balanced Accuracy and AUC, validating its robustness for deployment in high-stakes financial environments.
